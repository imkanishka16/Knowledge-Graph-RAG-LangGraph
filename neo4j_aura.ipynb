She was the last monarch of the House of Tudor.\\nElizabeth was the only surviving child of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. When Elizabeth was two years old, her parents\\' marriage was annulled, her mother was executed, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Henry restored her to the line of succession when she was 10, via the Third Succession Act 1543. After Henry\\'s death in 1547, Elizabeth\\'s younger half-brother Edward VI ruled until his own death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to a Protestant cousin, Lady Jane Grey, and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of statutes to the contrary. Edward\\'s will was set aside within weeks of his death and Mary became queen, deposing and executing Jane. During Mary\\'s reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\\nUpon her half-sister\\'s death in 1558, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, whom she created Baron Burghley. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the supreme governor. This era, later named the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, would evolve into the Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did, and because of this she is sometimes referred to as the \"Virgin Queen\". She was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots.\\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and siblings had been. One of her mottoes was video et taceo (\"I see and keep silent\"). In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570, which in theory released English Catholics from allegiance to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers\\' secret service, run by Sir Francis Walsingham. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland.

Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her fair share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer (\"Gloriana\") and a dogged survivor (\"Good Queen Bess\") in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones.

She is the daughter of Jere, a gift-basket business owner and Fred Berkley, a lawyer. She has an older brother, Jason. Her family is Jewish. She was raised in a Conservative Jewish household and had a bat mitzvah.\\nShe was born with partial heterochromia iridium, a condition of differently colored irises; her right eye is half green and half brown and her left eye is all green. She graduated from Calabasas High School in Calabasas, California.\\nFrom a young age, she danced and practiced in a room her parents set up for her in the basement. When she became interested in pursuing dance professionally, she traveled to New York City to train with dancers and choreographers. She performed in several ballets, including Swan Lake, and in 1983 she appeared in some musicals.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nBerkley was a teenage model for Elite before pursuing an acting career. She made her television debut in the television series Gimme a Break! in 1986. In 1989 she auditioned for the role of Kelly Kapowski in Saved by the Bell, but the producers of the show could not decide whether to cast Tiffani-Amber Thiessen or her. In the end, they created for Berkley the character Jessie Spano, a role she played from 1989 to 1993 in both the show\\'s television and film installments.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\n\\nAfter leaving Saved by the Bell to pursue a film career, Berkley won the role of Nomi Malone, the lead character in the controversial Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls (1995). The sex and nudity-laden film was given a NC-17 rating in the United States (the first big-budget film to receive the rating), was a box office bomb during its original, theatrical run, and was widely panned by critics. Berkley\\'s performance received negative reviews, with Todd McCarthy describing it in Variety as \"harsh, graceless and quickly tiresome\", and Janet Maslin of The New York Times writing that Berkley displayed \"the open-mouthed, vacant-eyed look of an inflatable party doll.\" In the wake of the film\\'s negative fallout, Berkley made a reportedly \"tempestuous\" exit from her talent agency ,  Creative Artists Agency, and spent the following week meeting with ICM, William Morris Agency and United Talent Agency, eventually signing with the latter. In January 1996, she landed a supporting role in The First Wives Club, a comedy starring Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, and Bette Midler. She then played a Madonna body-double named Tina in the independent film The Real Blonde.

Protestant theologian Heinrich August Wilhelm Meyer and Lutheran biblical commentator Johann Albrecht Bengel think that Mark is among those Luke has in mind, but Bengel suggests that Matthew and John were not. Luke also states he is not himself an eyewitness but belongs to another generation that received its information from \"eyewitnesses\" to these events in a previous generation. Some argue Luke thus states that he is getting his information from the disciples and Apostles, which the tradition about Luke being a follower of Paul accords with. Luke, however, does not say explicitly that he knew or interviewed Jesus\\' disciples, at least in the Gospel, and so some think \"handed down to us\" means the traditions and other documents about Jesus that came from witnesses of the previous generation, which Luke carefully researched, not necessarily from someone Luke actually knew.  Some sections of Acts, however, have the author relating events with the author and Paul together.\\nAccording to Franciscan theologian Robert J.

She was the firstborn child of a socially unequal marriage between Richard Woodville and Jacquetta of Luxembourg, which briefly scandalised the English court. The Woodvilles, though an old and respectable family, were gentry rather than noble, a landed and wealthy family that had previously produced commissioners of the peace, sheriffs, and MPs, rather than peers of the realm. Elizabeth\\'s mother, in contrast, was the eldest daughter of Peter I of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Conversano and Brienne, and as the widow of John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, uncle of King Henry VI of England, was before her second marriage one of the highest ranking women in England. As Jacquetta had pledged, upon the death of her first husband, that she would not remarry without first obtaining royal permission, and as royal permission to marry Woodville was out of the question, the pair married secretly. When the marriage became public knowledge, the couple was heavily fined, but was pardoned on 24 October 1437: it has been conjectured that the pardon coincided with the birth of Elizabeth, the couple\\'s firstborn child.\\nAround 1452, Elizabeth Woodville married John Grey of Groby, the heir to the Barony Ferrers of Groby.

At that time, the WWF featured an angle in which all the managers in the promotion competed to offer their services to Savage. During a match on July 30, 1985, in Poughkeepsie, New York, several managers were at ringside in hopes that he would name one of them as his new manager. After the match, Savage thanked the managers for their consideration and then asked that his new manager come to ringside. An attractive, unnamed woman then came down to the ring, and announcer Jesse Ventura remarked, \"She must be some sort of movie star,\" referring to her glamorous sex appeal. It was later revealed that her name was \"Miss Elizabeth\". Elizabeth\\'s WWF debut was taped on July 30, 1985, and aired on the August 24, 1985 edition of WWF Prime Time Wrestling. From that point on, she was the manager of Randy Savage.

In the angle, Steele fell in love with Elizabeth, angering Savage and leading to a series of grudge matches between him and Steele. Their feud was one of the WWF\\'s most popular of the 1980s; it carried on for more than a year, thanks to the feral Steele\\'s continued innocent crush on Elizabeth.\\nAfter \"injuring\" Ricky Steamboat\\'s larynx, Savage lost his WWF Intercontinental Championship to Steamboat at WrestleMania III on March 29, 1987. Steamboat later lost the title to The Honky Tonk Man, whose insistence that he was \"the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time\" instigated a challenge from Savage, the former champion. In their match, which aired on Saturday Night\\'s Main Event XII in September 1987, Honky shoved Elizabeth to the mat before assaulting Savage with a guitar. Elizabeth ran backstage and persuaded Hulk Hogan to rescue Savage, running off Honky and his allies, Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart and Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart. Throughout the Savage-Honky feud, a key point was Honky\\'s claim that Elizabeth secretly wanted him more than Savage. In several of their matches, Honky would try to corner Elizabeth, although Savage would always beat him back. In other Savage-Honky matches, a woman named \"Peggy Sue\" (usually Sherri Martel, or a dressed-up Jimmy \"Mouth of the South\" Hart) would harass Elizabeth at ringside, creating an advantage for Honky. At the 1987 Slammy Awards, Honky named Elizabeth \"Woman of the Year,\" but the honor was only to harass her and anger Savage; Savage quickly ran Honky off.\\nIn February 1988, Hulk Hogan, who had been the champion and the foundation upon which the WWF\\'s popularity was'),\n",

Her family later moved to Northport, Long Island, and maintained a home there. At an early age, Hendrickson showed an interest in the performing arts. \"Artistic people have always surrounded me,\" she stated in a Q&A interview, citing her actor/artist family as her inspiration for wanting to become an actress. \"Their talent and love for the arts continue to inspire me and always will.\" Her cousin is documentary filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch. By the age of 5, Hendrickson was tap dancing on tabletops at family weddings. As she aged, her love for performing deepened. My first play was in fourth grade, Johnny Appleseed. By the time I was in sixth grade, I knew that I wanted to be an actress. My dream has always been to be on Broadway. In eighth grade, I was one of the six finalists for New York for The Mickey Mouse Club. But I goofed on my screen test. It was my first professional audition. I heard the advertisement on the radio and I dragged my mother there. My favorite performance was my role in The Music Man my senior year in High School. I played Minnie. I had so much fun playing the little pipsqueak, it was so me!\\nHendrickson studied musical theatre at Syracuse University for two years before returning to New York. She transferred to Fordham College in her sophomore year.\\nShe auditioned for the roles of Bianca Montgomery, Rain Wilkins and Pine Valley High cheerleader Mindy on the daytime drama All My Children, but others were cast in the parts. She tried out as Guiding Light character Michelle Bauer Santos, a role that eventually went to actress Rebecca Budig.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== All My Children ===\\nIn 2001, when All My Children head writer Richard Culliton wanted to set up a murder storyline, he created character Mary Frances Stone (referred to onscreen as \"Frankie\"). Hendrickson was cast in the part. Her character was set to be the lesbian girlfriend of Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel) and be killed in 3 months.\\nIt was deemed unlikely that a homosexual pairing on a soap opera would be successful, but fan reaction to the Bianca and Frankie pairing was unprecedented. Unfortunately, the Culliton murder storyline could not be rewritten, so Frankie was killed and Bianca\\'s mother, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), was seen standing over her corpse holding a gun.\\nThis prompted uproar in the soap opera community, and producers quickly thought up a way to bring the actress back to the show. Rather than rewrite Frankie\\'s murder, the writers created her identical twin sister, Mary Margaret Stone (better known as Maggie), in 2002. Maggie quickly became instrumental in solving her sister\\'s murder.\\nStoryline tension was created when it was revealed that unlike Frankie, character Maggie was not gay.

Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include Blood Countess and Countess Dracula.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\n\\nElizabeth was born in 1560 on a family estate in Nyírbátor, Royal Hungary, and spent her childhood at Ecsed Castle. Her father was Baron George VI Báthory of the Ecsed branch of the family, brother of Andrew Bonaventura Báthory, who had been voivode of Transylvania. Her paternal great-grandparents were Anna Radziwiłł, a member of the influential Polish-Lithuanian Radziwiłł family, and Konrad the Red, Duke of Masovia and Warsaw, who was a member of the Piast dynasty. Her mother was Baroness Anna Báthory (1539–1570), daughter of Stephen Báthory of Somlyó. Through her mother, Elizabeth was the niece of Stephen Báthory (1533–1586), Prince of Transylvania, who became the ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. She had several siblings; her older brother Stephen (1555–1605) served as a Judge Royal of Hungary.\\nBáthory was raised a Calvinist Protestant, and learned Latin, German, Hungarian and Greek as a young woman. Born into a privileged noble family, she was endowed with wealth, education, and a prominent social rank. A proposal made by some sources in order to explain Báthory's cruelty later in her life is that she was trained by her family to be cruel.\\nAs a child, Báthory had multiple seizures that may have been caused by epilepsy. At the time, symptoms relating to epilepsy were diagnosed as falling sickness and treatments included rubbing blood of a non-sufferer on the lips of an epileptic or giving the epileptic a mix of a non-sufferer's blood and piece of skull as their episode ended.\\nAt the age of 13, before her first marriage, Báthory allegedly gave birth to a child. The child, said to have been fathered by a peasant boy, was supposedly given away to a local woman who was trusted by the Báthory family. The woman was paid for her actions, and the child was taken to Wallachia. Evidence of this pregnancy came up long after Elizabeth's death, through rumours spread by peasants; therefore, the validity of the rumour is often disputed.\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage and land ownership ===\\n\\nIn 1573, Báthory was engaged to Count Ferenc Nádasdy, a member of the Nadasdy family. It was a political arrangement within the circles of the aristocracy. Nádasdy was the son of Baron Tamás Nádasdy de Nádasd \"),\n",

In 1994, Hurley accompanied Hugh Grant to the London premiere of his film Four Weddings and a Funeral, in a plunging black Versace dress held together with gold safety pins, which gained her instant media attention.\\nHurley has been associated with the cosmetics company Estée Lauder since the company gave Hurley her first modelling job at the age of 29. They have featured her as a representative and model for their products, especially perfumes such as Sensuous, Intuition, and Pleasures, since 1995. Hurley owns a beachwear line.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nElizabeth Hurley was born on 10 June 1965 in Basingstoke, Hampshire, as the younger daughter of Angela Mary (née Titt) and Roy Leonard Hurley. Her father was a major in the Royal Army Educational Corps; her mother was a teacher at Kempshott Junior School. She has an older sister, Kate, and a younger brother, Michael.\\nHurley attended Harriet Costello School, a mixed secondary in Basingstoke, and, while in her teens, she became involved with punk fashion, dyeing her hair pink and piercing her nose. \"When I was 16 – this was about 1981, 1982 – the thing to be in Basingstoke, the suburb I grew up in, was punk,\" she explained. She reportedly associated with New Age travellers in her youth. Aspiring to be a dancer as a young girl, she enrolled in ballet classes. Hurley continued in the sixth form and took A-levels in English, Sociology and Psychology in 1983 before studying dance and theatre at the London Studio Centre.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Film ===\\nHurley made her first film appearance in Aria (1987). She subsequently appeared in the movies Passenger 57, EDtv, Bedazzled,  Serving Sara and Dangerous Ground. In 1997, she co-starred with Mike Myers in the spy spoof Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. \\nWhen Hugh Grant founded and became the director of Simian Films in 1994, Hurley was credited as one of the producers for the company\\'s two Grant vehicles, Extreme Measures (1996) and Mickey Blue Eyes (1999). In 2000, she was publicly criticised for breaking a five-month acting strike to film an Estée Lauder advertisement, for which she was fined $100,000 (£70,000 in 2000) by the Screen Actors Guild and labelled \"Elizabeth Scably\" by protestors.\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\n\\nIn 1988, Hurley appeared briefly in a speaking part as a schoolgirl in \"Last Seen Wearing\", an episode of the detective series Inspector Morse, which was partly filmed at Reading Blue Coat School, Sonning, Berkshire. In the same year she played Rosie Japhet in an episode of  Rumpole of the Bailey (\"Rumpole and the Barrow Boy\"). In late 1988, Hurley portrayed the title character in a four-part television drama, Christabel. After appearing in John Cleese\\'s The Human Face (2001), she hosted the inaugural series of the British reality show Project Catwalk on Sky 1 in 2006. Hurley was criticised as a presenter by Marcelle D\\'Argy Smith, a former editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, who said: \"Liz Hurley has no fashion experience whatsoever. She wore a dress and has appeared at premieres.\" GQ\\'s Dylan Jones defended her as someone \"immersed in the fashion world as a celebrity.\" She was dropped after one series because her bosses reportedly believed she was too wooden.\\nIn 2011, Hurley filmed a guest star role in the series pilot of NBC\\'s Wonder Woman as the villain Veronica Cale. The network decided not to pick up the series. In July 2011, it was announced th'),\n",
